## How to make pages

To make pages, simply place them as .txt files in the `pagesources` folder. They should be formatted in the [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) format.

When you click `Convert.bat`, it'll generate the HTML files for the staticwiki theme we're using in the staticwiki folder. Feel free to alter the theme, as well as `Convert.bat`! You can change the wiki title there.
