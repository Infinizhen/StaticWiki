# Extensions

Some Markdown extensions are enabled by default, such as [piped tables](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables). Right now there is no possibility to change which are enabled by default,
but in a future release that will be doable.

# Page Titles

The `Title` option in `staticwiki.ini` is the base page title - The pages generated will have a title in the form of `Title - Current Page Title`.

Current Page Title will have `_`'s replaced with spaces, so a page like `Page_Sample` will become `Page Sample`.

Pages can have a custom title by using the `[title]` tag. For example, `[title]My title[/title}`.

# Linking Pages

Processed pages will have the same file extension as the theme file.

You can link to other pages by specifying their path as if you were in the root directory.
So if I have my wiki at a specific spot, and I want to link to `Sample/Markdown_Sample.md`, I just need to do something like `[my link](Sample/Markdown_Sample)`.
If a non-URL link has no file extension and it is a page that already exists, it'll automatically get the proper file extension.

# Categories

Categories can be added to a page by adding the `[categories]` tag at the start of the page. For example, `[categories]Sample, Markdown[/categories]`.
Additionally, you can create category pages in your sources (with their name in the form of `Category_name`) to add some content to your category page.

# Custom HTML and images

You can use custom HTML for displaying your content, although you can't combine it with Markdown as you might expect.
Essentially, you can add HTML to your Markdown, separate from the Markdown itself. You cannot combine them at the same time.

So, for instance, you can do:

```
<strong><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a></strong>
```

But not:

```
<strong>[Google](http://www.google.com)</strong>
```

For adding an image in a custom way, such as a custom size, you can do simple HTML like:

```
<img src="my image.png" width="my width" height="my height">
```

Or:

```
<img src="my image.png" style="border:1; width:my width; height: my height">
```

- `{TITLE}` - should be placed on the &lt;title&gt; tag
